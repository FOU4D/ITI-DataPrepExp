For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers."

    "3. **Mandatory Constraints:** certain columns cannot be empty.\n",
    "4. **Unique Constraints:** a field, or a combination of fields, must be unique across a dataset.\n",
    "5. **Set-Membership constraints:** values of a column come from a set of discrete values, e.g. enum values. For example, a person’s gender may be male or female.\n",
    "6. **Foreign-key constraints:** as in relational databases, a foreign key column can’t have a value that does not exist in the referenced primary key.\n",
    "7. **Regular expression patterns:** text fields that have to be in a certain pattern. For example, phone numbers may be required to have the pattern (999) 999–9999.\n",
    "8. **Cross-field validation:** certain conditions that span across multiple fields must hold. For example, a patient’s date of discharge from the hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission."
